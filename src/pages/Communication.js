          Recognising that many of you shall soon embark on demanding professional careers, we shall make every effort to limit post-Fellowship communications via phone to essential circumstances. We appreciate your understanding if we occasionally need to reach out through these channels when necessary. Further details of the Foundation’s communication channels are mentioned in the Contact section of this document.
